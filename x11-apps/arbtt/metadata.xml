		arbtt is a background daemon that stores which windows are open, which one
		has the focus and how long since your last action (and possbly more sources
		later), and stores this. It is also a program that will, based on
		expressive rules you specify, derive what you were doing, and what for.
		
		The documentation, which includes the changelog, can also be found at
		&lt;http://arbtt.nomeata.de/doc/users_guide/&gt;.
		
		WARNING: The log file might contain very sensitive private data. Make sure
		you understand the consequences of a full-time logger and be careful with this
		data.
