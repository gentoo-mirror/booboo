		Some classes for generalized boolean operations.
		Starting with 0.1.0, this package uses type families.
		Up to version 0.0.2, it used MPTCs with functional dependencies.
		My thanks to Andy Gill for suggesting &amp; helping with the change.
		Thanks also to Alex Horsman for Data.Boolean.Overload and to
		Jan Bracker for Data.Boolean.Numbers.
